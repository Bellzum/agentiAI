    "**When to use Custom Tools?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in tools like Google Search are powerful, but **every business has unique requirements** that generic tools can't handle. Custom tools let you implement your specific business logic, connect to your systems, and solve domain-specific problems. ADK provides multiple custom tool types to handle these scenarios."

    "**1. Dictionary Returns**: Tools return `{\"status\": \"success\", \"data\": ...}` or `{\"status\": \"error\", \"error_message\": ...}`  \n",
    "**2. Clear Docstrings**: LLMs use docstrings to understand when and how to use tools  \n",
    "**3. Type Hints**: Enable ADK to generate proper schemas (`str`, `dict`, etc.)  \n",
    "**4. Error Handling**: Structured error responses help LLMs handle failures gracefully  \n",

    "**Agent Tools (what we're using):**\n",
    "- Agent A calls Agent B as a tool\n",
    "- Agent B's response goes **back to Agent A**\n",

    "- **Use case**: Delegation for specific tasks (like calculations)\n",

    "**Sub-Agents (different pattern):**\n",
    "- Agent A transfers control **completely to Agent B**\n",
    "- Agent B takes over and handles all future user input\n",
    "- Agent A is out of the loop\n",
    "- **Use case**: Handoff to specialists (like customer support tiers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our currency example:** We want the currency agent to get calculation results and continue working with them, so we use **Agent Tools**, not sub-agents."
