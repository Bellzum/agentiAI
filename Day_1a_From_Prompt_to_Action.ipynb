It aims to make agent development more akin to traditional software development, providing developers with greater control and flexibility in creating, deploying, and orchestrating agentic architectures. ADK is optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem but is model-agnostic and compatible with other frameworks. It offers features such as flexible orchestration, multi-agent architecture, a rich tool ecosystem, and built-in evaluation.\n\nThe ADK SDK is available in the following languages:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Go**\n*   **Java**\n",
