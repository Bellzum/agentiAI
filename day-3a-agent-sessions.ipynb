    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Here's a summary of recent news and trends in AI in healthcare, covering a few key areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Advancements in Diagnostics and Imaging:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AI for Faster and More Accurate Diagnoses:** AI continues to make significant strides in analyzing medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides). Recent developments focus on detecting subtle anomalies that might be missed by the human eye, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses for conditions like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "*   **AI-Powered Radiomics:** This field uses AI to extract quantitative features from medical images that are not visible to the human eye. These features can predict treatment response, disease progression, and patient outcomes, offering a more personalized approach to treatment.\n",
      "*   **Early Detection of Neurological Disorders:** AI algorithms are being developed to identify early signs of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurological conditions through analyzing brain scans, speech patterns, and even subtle changes in gait.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Drug Discovery and Development:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Accelerating Drug Discovery:** AI is dramatically speeding up the process of identifying potential drug candidates. It can analyze vast datasets of biological information, predict molecular interactions, and identify promising compounds for further research, significantly reducing the time and cost of drug development.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine and Treatment Optimization:** AI is crucial in developing personalized treatment plans. By analyzing a patient's genetic makeup, medical history, and other data, AI can predict which treatments are most likely to be effective and minimize side effects.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Clinical Trial Success:** AI models are being used to predict the likelihood of success for clinical trials, helping pharmaceutical companies allocate resources more effectively and prioritize the most promising drug candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. AI in Clinical Workflows and Patient Care:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AI-Powered Virtual Assistants and Chatbots:** These tools are increasingly used for patient triage, answering common health questions, scheduling appointments, and providing medication reminders. This can free up healthcare professionals' time and improve patient engagement.\n",

      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned in the context of AI in drug discovery. That was:\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Accelerating Target Identification and Validation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's dive deeper into what this means and why it's so crucial:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before a drug can be developed, scientists need to identify a specific biological molecule (like a protein, enzyme, or receptor) that is involved in a disease process. This molecule is called the **drug target**. The idea is that a drug can be designed to interact with this target in a way that interrupts or corrects the disease mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenge of Finding Targets:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, identifying and validating drug targets has been one of the most time-consuming, expensive, and failure-prone stages of drug discovery. This is because:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Complexity of Biology:** The human body is incredibly complex. Diseases often involve intricate networks of interacting molecules, and pinpointing the *key* player that can be effectively targeted is difficult.\n",
      "*   **Data Overload:** We now have vast amounts of biological data available (from genomics, proteomics, etc.), but it's impossible for humans to manually analyze and connect all the dots.\n",
      "*   **Subtle Involvement:** Many molecules are involved in disease, but only a few are truly \"druggable\" and can be effectively modulated by a therapeutic agent without causing unacceptable side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and making predictions from large, complex datasets. Here's how it's applied:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Analyzing \"Omics\" Data:**\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** AI can scan an individual's DNA sequence or compare the genomes of healthy and diseased populations to identify genes or genetic variations that are strongly associated with a particular disease.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** AI can analyze the types and quantities of proteins present in cells or tissues. Changes in protein expression or function can be indicators of disease and potential targets.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI can study the RNA molecules (which are transcribed from DNA) to understand which genes are being actively expressed and at what levels, providing insights into cellular activity and disease states.\n",
      "    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can analyze the small molecules (metabolites) in biological samples to understand metabolic pathways that are altered in disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Network Biology and Systems Biology:**\n",
      "    *   AI algorithms can build detailed maps of biological networks – how proteins interact, how genes regulate each other, and how these systems respond to stimuli.\n",
      "    *   By analyzing these networks, AI can identify \"bottlenecks,\" critical nodes, or key regulatory points that, if targeted, could disrupt disease progression. This is like finding the \"weakest link\" in a chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs:**\n",
      "    *   AI can \"read\" and synthesize information from millions of scientific papers, patents, and clinical trial databases.\n",
      "    *   It can build \"knowledge graphs\" that connect genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, and experimental findings, uncovering relationships that human researchers might miss. This helps in hypothesis generation and understanding existing research more comprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Predicting \"Druggability\":**\n",
      "    *   Once a potential target is identified, AI can help assess its \"druggability\" – the likelihood that a molecule can be designed to bind to it effectively and safely. This involves analyzing the target's structure, its binding pockets, and its role in cellular pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is This So Important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Faster Drug Development:** Identifying a good target early on is the bedrock of successful drug discovery. By speeding this up, AI significantly shortens the overall timeline.\n",
      "*   **Higher Success Rates:** AI's ability to analyze complex data and make more informed predictions can lead to the identification of more robust and relevant targets, potentially increasing the likelihood of a drug reaching the market.\n",
      "*   **Novel Therapies:** By uncovering previously unknown biological mechanisms and targets, AI can pave the way for entirely new classes of drugs and treatments for diseases that are currently poorly managed.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Costs:** Identifying the wrong target early on is incredibly costly. AI helps de-risk this initial phase, saving significant resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI acts as a powerful magnifying glass and intelligent interpreter for the overwhelming amount of biological data, helping scientists find the most promising starting points for developing new medicines.\n",
